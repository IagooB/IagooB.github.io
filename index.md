### Fake News Detection – Political Context (Spain)

<div class="project-meta">
NLP · Machine Learning · BERT · FastAPI · Web Scraping
</div>

I developed an automated system to detect fake news in the political domain, with a special focus on 
electoral processes in Spain. The project uses Natural Language Processing and machine learning to classify 
news articles as **true** or **fake**, and exposes the model through a web API.

**Key points:**

- Collects and preprocesses political news from multiple sources.
- Trains models based on BERT and traditional classifiers (Random Forest, SVM).
- Includes web scraping pipelines for both true and fake news.
- Offers a web interface and API for real-time classification.
