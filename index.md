<h1>Hello, I’m Iago</h1>

<p class="tagline">
I’m a Machine Learning researcher focused on AI privacy, federated learning, and the analysis of political and social information.
</p>

## What I work on

- Designing and evaluating privacy attacks and defenses in Federated Learning systems.
- Building machine learning and NLP models (Transformers, BERT, classical ML) for tasks such as political news and disinformation detection.
- Working with real-world, messy datasets from politics, elections, social media, and public policy.
- Developing data pipelines with web scraping, APIs, and databases to turn raw data into usable datasets and prototypes.

## Currently

- Researcher at the Internet Interdisciplinary Institute (IN3), studying the privacy and security of Federated Learning and AI systems.
- Combining Applied Data Science and Political Science to address questions around disinformation, electoral behavior, and public communication.

## Interests

- AI privacy, security, and trustworthy ML.
- Natural Language Processing and large language models.
- Computational social science and political data analysis.
- Turning research ideas into working code and reproducible experiments.
