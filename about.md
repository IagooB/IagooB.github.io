## About me

I’m Iago, a Machine Learning researcher focused on AI privacy, federated learning, and the analysis of political and social information. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

My background combines Applied Data Science and Political Science, which allows me to bridge advanced technical methods with real-world socio-political problems such as disinformation, electoral behavior, and public policy analysis. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

Currently, I work as a researcher at the Internet Interdisciplinary Institute (IN3), where I study the privacy and security of Federated Learning systems. My work involves designing white-box and grey-box inference attacks, evaluating privacy risks, and exploring defense mechanisms for more secure AI systems. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

I enjoy:

- Working with real-world, messy datasets and turning them into actionable insights.
- Building prototypes quickly and iterating on them with feedback.
- Combining web technologies (APIs, web apps) with machine learning models.
- Applying NLP and network analysis to political and social data.
- Exploring how AI can be used responsibly in high-impact domains like politics and public communication.

## Selected work & interests

- **ML Privacy & Federated Learning:** Research on attack strategies against FL networks (white-box and grey-box inference attacks) and the evaluation of privacy-enhancing techniques. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- **Real-time political disinformation detection:** Development of a BERT-based model to classify Spanish political news, combining transformers with classical ML models and an end-to-end data pipeline built via web scraping and SQL. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- **Computational social science:** Quantitative analyses of electoral and environmental data, sentiment analysis on social media, and social network analysis of political actors. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  

You can find some of these ideas reflected in the repositories pinned on this profile.
